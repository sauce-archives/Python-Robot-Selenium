Your tests and testing environments may require you to modify this framework. Issues regarding this framework should be submitted through GitHub. For questions regarding Sauce Labs integration, please see the Sauce Labs documentation at https://wiki.saucelabs.com/. This framework is not maintained by Sauce Labs Support.

### Note: Robot framework does not currently support Microsoft Edge. However, if you set the robot browser to firefox and then specify "MicrosoftEdge" in the desired capabilities for Sauce Labs, the tests will run as expected.
